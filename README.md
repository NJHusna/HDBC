### Features & Technology

#### Dashboard App
_Interactive Visualization_: Explore a variety of charts and graphs built using **Streamlit** to understand booking and cancellation trends.
_Data Query_: Data is retrieved using a local data warehouse method powered by **DuckDB**, known for its superior performance in analytical data querying on edge devices.
_Container Deployment_: The application is packaged as a container image using **Docker** and deployed with **Azure Container Apps**.

#### Data Engineering
_Data Modelling_: Organizing hotel booking data into structured tables for efficient retrieval.
_Data Transformation_: Employing **dbt** as the transformation framework, including data cleaning, aggregation, and enrichment.
_Data Warehouse_: Utilizing **DuckDB** as the local data warehouse for fast query performance on analytical workloads.
_Medallion Framework_: Following the **Databricks medallion framework** to organize data into multiple layers (raw, bronze, silver, and gold) based on its processing stage and quality.

### Purpose

This project serves as a demonstration of the skillset

- Dimensional Data Modelling
- Data Transformation
- Data Warehousing using [Medallion Architecture](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture)

### Key Components

_Dimensional Modelling_: Utilizing **star schemas** to organize sports data into fact tables and dimension tables for effiecient retrieval.

_Data Transformation_: Employing **dbt** as the transformation framework, including data cleaning, aggregating, and enriching data.

_Data Warehouse_: Utilizing **DuckDB** as the local data warehouse for fast query performance on analytical workloads.

_Medallion Framework_: Following the **Databricks medallion framework** to organize data into multiple layers (raw, bronze, silver, and gold) based on its processing stage and quality.

### Requirements

To run the Tennis Analytics Data Warehouse locally, you'll need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.10
- dbt
- DuckDB
- Other necessary Python libraries (specified in requirements.txt)

You can install the required dependencies by run the following command:
```bash
pip -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
#### Dashboard App
To launch the dashboard, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```bash
streamlit run hdbc_streamlit.py
``` 
This will start a local server, and you can access the dashboard through your web browser.

### Data Engineering
The post-transformed database binary file is included as `hdbc.duckdb` for ease of usage. To reload the database from raw datasets, run the following command:

```bash
cd hdbc
dbt run
```
